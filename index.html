      <h2>Rooms</h2>

      <p>
Escape My Room features rooms inspired by the DeLaporte mansion which was torn
down to make way for a new hospital complex near the Superdome.  Before the
house was demolished, everything within it was removed and placed into storage.
      </p>

      <p>
In each escape room you will uncover mysteries involving the secretive
DeLaporte family and their hidden role in shaping the history of New Orleans.

      <h3>Mardi Gras Study</h3>

      <p>
The year is 1990, and Odette DeLaporte has invited you to her study. As the
last remaining heir in New Orleans to the DeLaporte fortune, she needs your
help locating a treasure which went missing a long time ago.
      </p>

      <p>
The reclusive matriarch has not been seen in public for quite some time, yet
she has agreed to meet with you with the hope that you can recover what’s been
lost.

members as they comb the crime scene for evidence. Can the two groups cooperate

forever?

The Jazz Parlor features relics of New Orleans’ most bizarre family, and

<ul>

<li>
Arrive 15 minutes before your scheduled time to have a chance to view the
museum in the waiting room.  Please do not arrive later than your scheduled
ticket time or you may not be allowed entry into the room.  We ask that you not
arrive more than 30 minutes early as we may still be setting up the room from
the previous visit.
</li>

<li>
Expect to be on our premises for up to 90 minutes.  While you are only inside
of the room for 1 hour, this includes time to view the museum and get
acquainted with the story before entering the room.
</li>

<li>
Wear comfortable clothes.  You may need to get on your hands and knees in order
to solve a puzzle.
</li>

<li>
You may find it helpful to bring your reading glasses.  Other than that, you
won’t need any tools besides your working mind.  We’ll require you to lock all
personal belongings in a locker before entering the room.  
</li>

<li>
Visibly intoxicated guests will not be permitted entry, and will not receive a
refund.  If you’ve had too much to drink, you may not have the ability to solve
the puzzles.
</li>

<li>
Upon entering the room, you have exactly one hour.
</li>

</ul>

<h5>Will I actually be locked in a room for an hour?</h5>
<p>
Yes, but there is a panic button if anyone is uncomfortable and wants to
exit sooner.  No re-entry into the room will be allowed for anyone who leaves,
but guests who do not leave can continue playing the game.
</p>

<h5>Is the room scary?</h5>
<p>
No, Escape My Room is not meant to be scary, but it is mysterious.  Your
success depends on teamwork and problem-solving, NOT outrunning zombies or
serial killers.
</p>

<h5>Is the room safe for kids?</h5>
<p>
Escape My Room can be fun for kids as long as there is adult supervision.  We
don’t recommend it for kids younger than 10, but all ages are allowed.  There
are no discounts for children.  Well-behaved children over the age of 15 may
not require adult supervision, but please write to us in advance.
</p>

<h5>Is the subject matter appropriate for kids?</h5>
<p>
If Escape My Room were a movie, we think it would get a PG rating.  New Orleans
is a city that has a dark history—slavery, prostitution, the mafia, and
horrific disasters.  Some of those topics may be brought up in the story of the
rooms.  If you have a specific concern, please write to us directly, and we’ll
do our best to answer your question.
</p>

<h5>Will other people be in the room?</h5>
<p>
There are 7 tickets available for each time slot.  If you are a group of less
than 7 people, and do not want anyone else in the room with you, then you will
need to book all 7 tickets.
</p>

<h5>How many people can the room hold? Can we bring 8 people?</h5>
<p>
The room holds 7 adults, and we don’t recommend bringing any additional people.
If you absolutely must bring a 8th guest, you must have booked the entire room
(all 7 tickets), and you will be able to pay for them when you arrive.
</p>

<h5>Will I have the room to myself/ourselves?</h5>
<p>
There are 7 tickets for each time slot available.  If you want the room to
yourself, you will need to book all 7 tickets or there is a chance that there
will be other guests with you.
</p>

<h5>What is the minimum number of people you recommend?</h5>
<p>
Two people have successfully solved the room in under an hour, and one could
probably solve it.  That being said, we recommend at least 3 to 4 people
minimum.  If you are only booking two tickets, you might want to join another
group or bring some friends.
</p>

<h5>Can I eat or drink in the rooms?</h5>
<p>
Unfortunately, we do not allow food or drinks into the rooms because the
artifacts could get damaged if there were a spill.  You are welcome to show up
early and eat or drink in the waiting room.  Water bottles are allowed.
</p>

<h5>Is the room handicapped accessible?</h5>
<p>
Yes, but it depends on the handicap and your group may require an extra docent
or other participants to help.  Please write to us at info@escapemyroom.com to
discuss your specific situation before booking so we can make proper
accommodations.
</p>

<h5>What if I don’t escape after an hour?</h5>
<p>
If you do not escape after one hour, an attendant will enter the room and show
you the clues you missed.  Only around 30% of groups escape on time, so don’t
feel discouraged if you don’t escape.
</p>

<h5>Is photography allowed?</h5>
<p>
Photography is allowed and encouraged in the waiting room and DeLaporte Family
Museum, but it is strictly prohibited in the escape rooms, where it could be
damaging to the integrity of the puzzles and the privacy of the DeLaporte
family.
</p>

<h5>What if I run late?</h5>
<p>
Escape My Room runs on a tight schedule which requires that participants arrive
on time.  You should arrive 15 minutes prior to the time on your ticket.  You
may not be allowed into the room if you show up later than your ticketed time.
</p>

<h5>Can I get a refund?</h5>
<p>
All ticket sales are final, and we generally do not give refunds for any
reason.  You are welcome to sell or give your ticket away to someone else.
</p>

<h5>Can I revisit the same room?</h5>
<p>
No, you cannot revisit the same room since you would already know how to solve
it and escape.  We plan on opening more rooms in the future, and if you sign up
for our mailing list, you’ll be the first to hear about them.
</p>

<h5>Can I have a party at Escape My Room?</h5>
<p>
It depends on the group size and the time. The Mardi Gras study only holds 7
people at a time, so if your group is larger than 7, it would have to be split
up into separate groups.  Please write to us at info@escapemyroom.com with the
date/time you are interested in and the total party size.
</p>

<h5>Is Escape My Room affiliated with the Federal Government?</h5>
<p>
No. Though located in an office building owned by the Federal Government,
Escape My Room is in no way owned nor managed by the U.S. Postal Service. We
are only tenants of the building.
