book as many or as few

<!-- "About rooms" POPUP CONTENT START -->

<p>
Despite efforts from the Preservation Resource Center and the Louisiana
Landmarks Society, the DeLaporte home was demolished yesterday to make room for
the new University Medical Center.  The house stood for almost two centuries
and was once part of a much larger estate that stretched from the edge of the
French Quarter to Lake Pontchartrain. 
</p>

<p>
Property records indicate that it is was owned by La Valliere LLC, a shell
corporation registered in the Cayman Islands.  This made it all but impossible
to track down the current owners.
</p>

<p>
It was most recently inhabited by Mrs. Odette DeLaporte, who operated various
family businesses after her husband passed away in the great storm of 1947.
After her daughter vanished on Mardi Gras day in 1954, she became a recluse and
was rarely seen.
</p>

<p>
Although the grounds continued to be maintained, the home slowly deteriorated
and deemed a public hazardóits crumbling walls became a target for vandalizers
and urban explorers.  Deterioration was hastened when a fire destroyed part of
the roof in early 2000.  
</p>

<p>
In July of 2005, a group of determined urban explorers accessed the home,
attempting to photograph and catalogue its interior.  One of the explorers
described the state of the ruins,
</p>

<blockquote>
“It was of old brick, and dismal, and had a great many iron bars to
it. Some of the windows had been walled up; of those that remained, all the
lower were rustily barred.  Despite being abandoned, It retained the appearance
of order.  Books still sat on the shelves, slippers by an armchair.  It was
like everything in the room had stopped, like the hands on a watch or a clock,
a long time ago.  We were so mesmerized by the bizarre collection of items that
we barely had time to walk through the first floor before neighborhood patrol
arrived and kicked us out.  Weirdly, none of us even managed to snap a good
photo.  Our cards all malfunctioned and were empty!  We hoped to return to take
more pictures, but then it was too late.”
</blockquote>

<p>
Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans on August 29, 2005, and when neighbors slowly
started returning to the neighborhood, they realized that the Delaporte Mansion
had been emptied, presumably by looters.
</p>

<p>
“Thank goodness they didnít get in my house,” said Harvey Wellington, a
long-time neighbor.  “The only house looted on the whole block was the one
nobody was living in.  Lucky, I guess.”
</p>

<p>
The house was built in 1792 by Andree and Marguerite Delaporte when they were
granted a plot of land from King Louis XIV of France.  For their wealth, New
Orleans society forgave the DeLaportes their eccentricity.  The family lineage
was not infrequently marred with scandal and infamy.  Once New Orleans’ finest
residence, the DeLaporte mansion and artifacts are now the stuff of legend.

<ul>

<li>
Walk-ins are not allowed, please purchase tickets online at least one hour in
advance.
</li>

<li>
Arrive on time to view the family museum.  Please do not arrive more than 15
minutes late as you may not be allowed entry.  
</li>

<li>
Expect to be on our premises for up to 2 hours.  While you are only inside of
the room for 1 hour, this includes time to view the museum and get acquainted
with the story before entering the room.
</li>

<li>
Visibly intoxicated guests will not be permitted entry, and will not receive a
refund.  If you’ve had too much to drink, you may not have the ability to solve
the puzzles.
</li>


<li>
Escape My Room was not designed for children under the age of 12.  Children
under 12 are only allowed if your group has reserved all 8 tickets for the
room.
</li>

<li>
You may find it helpful to bring your reading glasses.  Other than that, bring
nothing but a working mind. 
</li>

<li>
Upon entering the room, you have exactly one hour to escape.
</li>


</ul>

<!-- XXX -->
<h5>Will I actually be locked in a room for an hour?</h5>
<p>
Yes, but there is a panic button if anyone is uncomfortable and wants to exit
sooner.  No re-entry into the room will be allowed for anyone who leaves, but
guests who do not leave can continue playing the game.
</p>

<h5>Is the room scary?</h5>
<p>
No, Escape My Room is not meant to be scary, but it is mysterious.  It is more
a mental puzzle solving and teamwork challenge to escape.
</p>

<h5>Is the room kid friendly?</h5>
<p>
Escape My Room was not designed for children younger than 12.  Children under
12 are not allowed unless your group has purchased all 8 tickets for the room.
It can still be fun for kids as long as there is adult supervision.
</p>

<h5>Is the subject matter appropriate for kids?</h5>
<p>
If Escape My Room was a movie, we think it would get a PG rating.  New Orleans
is a city that has a dark history—slavery, prostitution, the mafia, and
horrific disasters.  Some of those topics may be brought up in the story of the
rooms.  If you have a specific concern, please write to us directly, and we’ll
do our best to answer your question.
</p>

<h5>Will other people be in the room?</h5>
<p>
There are 8 tickets available for each time slot.  If you are a group of less
than 8 people, and do not want anyone else in the room with you, then you will
need to book all 8 tickets.
</p>

<h5>How many people can the room hold?  Can we bring 9 people?</h5>
<p>
The room holds 8 adults, and we don’t recommend bringing any additional people.
If you absolutely must bring a 9th guest, you must have booked the entire room
(all 8 tickets), and you will be able to pay for them when you arrive.
</p>

<h5>Will I have the room to myself/ourselves?</h5>
<p>
There are 8 tickets for each time slot available.  If you want the room to
yourself, you will need to book all 8 tickets or there is a chance that there
will be other guests with you.
</p>

<h5>What is the minimum number of people you recommend?</h5>
<p>
Two people have successfully solved the room in under an hour, and one could
probably solve it.  That being said, we recommend at least 3 to 4 people
minimum.  If you are only booking two tickets, you might want to join another
group or bring some friends.
</p>

<h5>Can I eat or drink in the rooms?</h5>
<p>
Unfortunately, we do not allow food or drinks into the rooms because the
artifacts could get damaged if there was a spill.  You are welcome to show up
early and eat or drink in the waiting room.  Water bottles are allowed.
</p>

<h5>Is the room handicapped accessible?</h5>
<p>
Yes, but it depends on the handicap and your group may require an extra docent
or other participants to help.  Please write to us at info@escapemyroom.com to
discuss your specific situation before booking so we can make proper
accommodations.
</p>

<h5>What if I don’t escape after an hour?</h5>
<p>
If you do not escape after one hour, an attendant will enter the room and show
you the clues you missed.  Only around 30% of groups escape on time, so don’t
feel discouraged if you don’t escape.
</p>

<h5>Is photography allowed?</h5>
<p>
Photography is allowed and encouraged in the waiting room, but not in the
escape rooms in order to protect the integrity of the puzzles and the the
privacy of the DeLaporte family.
</p>

<h5>What if I run late?</h5>
<p>
Escape My Room runs on a tight schedule which requires that participants arrive
on time.  The time on your ticket is when you should be walking in our front
door.  There is no need to arrive early, but if you are more than 15 minutes
late you may forfeit your ticket and not be allowed into the room.
</p>

<h5>Can I get a refund?</h5>
<p>
All ticket sales are final, and we generally do not give refunds for any
reason.  You are welcome to sell or give your ticket away to someone else.
</p>

<h5>Can I revisit the same room?</h5>
<p>
No, you cannot revisit the same room since you would already know how to solve
it and escape.  We plan on opening more rooms in the future, and if you sign up
for our mailing list, you’ll be the first to hear about them.
</p>

<h5>Can I have a party at Escape My Room?</h5>
<p>
Please write to us at info@escapemyroom.com with the date/time you are
interested in and the total party size.
